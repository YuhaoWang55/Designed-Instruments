# Introduction
This system is designed for controlling the atmosphere on a 90mm petri-dish plate. Experimentally, nitrogen was injected into the system where a B. subtilis swarm plate was placed, to cease the motility of B. subtilis swarm cells. It was shown that B. subtilis was very sensitive to nitrogen, becoming immotile fast when nitrogen filled. Meantime, the immotile B. subtilis will recover to the normal motile state when nitrogen is off, so that several times of immotile-motile state can be realized. But E. coli needs much more time to slow down in comparision with B. subtilis in the same culturing condition.
``Noted nitrogen flow will take away the humidity in the atmosphere so that the plate will be dry. Wet nitrogen can be considered to solve the problem.``
