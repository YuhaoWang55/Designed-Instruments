## Protocol

### I. Preparation

1. Open the Ti microscope, select the eyepiece port. Choose a proper objective (NA>0.9 is recommended) and put the a sample on.
   - a. Move the sample to a blank region for avoiding photodamage on regions of interest.
   - b. $$\textrm{\color{red}Alarm: make sure the laser power is turned off when switching to a camera port!}$$
2. Insert the CFP filterset ($$\textrm{\color{red}with the excitation filter removed}$$) into the lower filter turret on the microscope.
   - a. $$\textrm{\color{red}Alarm: make sure the emission filter is in position!}$$

3. Plug in the USB of the arduino chip.
4. Plug in the socket of the power supply.

5. Open NIS Elements software.
6. Open 'Command' dialogue, choose and open the correspoding serial port.
   - a. $$\textrm{\color{red}Upon opening the port, there will be a transient blink from the laser.}$$
   - b. Make sure the 'Terminater by CR' is ticked.

7. Write 'o1' (open 2% power) to the serial port, the laser power is then turned on to a low level.
8. Use eyepiece port to adjust the focus.
   * a. $$\textrm{\color{red}Alarm: make sure the emission filter is in position before this step!}$$
   * b. The laser spot should be located at the left field of view.
   * c. A perfect focus is reached when a rectangle spot is observed.
   * d. When a distorted laser spot, e.g., a tilted cone is observed, the obtical path is shifted. Call Wang Yuhao for re-adjusting the obtical path.

9. Write 'c0' (close to 0% power) to the serial port, the laser power is then turned off.

### II. Test and ablate

$$\textrm{\color{red}It is highly recommended to Wear a laser protective glass in the following steps.}$$

1. Move the sample to a testing region.
2. Set ablation parameters and test:
   * a. Open the 'laser ablation point' macro
   * b. Set the \textrm{\color{red}power}$$ in 'WritePort(9,"o\textrm{\color{red}50}$$",13,0);', 50% power by default;
   * c. Set the ablation \textrm{\color{red}time (s)}$$ in 'Wait(\textrm{\color{red}2}$$);', 1 s ablation by default;
   * d. Execute and examine the ablation effect. Change parameters if necessary.3

3. Set ablation points and ablate:
   * a. Set the coordinates of ablation points in 'ND Acquisition';
   * b. Tick the 'Execute Command' and choose the macro 'laser ablation point';
   * c. Execute by 'Run Now'.

4. Examine the ablation results, close the serial port, and close NIS elements.
5. Unplug the socket of the power supply and the USB of the arduino chip.
